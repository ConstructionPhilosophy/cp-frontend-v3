Your Construction Philosophy Q&A platform is now **fully configured** for Firebase hosting deployment!

## ✅ What's Been Configured

### Firebase Configuration Files
- **`firebase.json`** - Hosting configuration with SPA routing
- **`.firebaserc`** - Project settings for `construction-philosophy-test`

### 2. Login to Firebase
```bash
firebase login
```

### 3. Build & Deploy
